-------------------------
Mark design:

Specify:
  x-index - would work on any.
  special values of 'high', 'low', 'first', and 'last'
  need to supply a color.
  Supply one point/color pair
  Supply list of point/color pairs

mark => [
    high=>'blue', low=>'red', first=>'green', last=>'#080',
    2=>'#0ff', 8=>'#555'
]

mark => [ high=>'#6f6' ]

I'll need a virtual method in the type.

How mark is displayed:
  Area    - vertical line from 0 to data point - DONE
  Bar     - the bar in question - DONE
  Line    - dot at point (might want to control dot size) - DONE
  Whisker - the whole whisker at the index - DONE
