Future features.

 1. Better attribute validation.
    a. Should generate an error on unrecognized parameters.
 2. Possibly DataUtility module that simplifies making the data for
    RangeArea and RangeBar?
 3. Change the gallery to use object or embed to reduce the error messages
    generated by IE.
 4. Possible ability to do compressed SVG
 5. Ability to change the mark
    a. Size
    b. Style (cross vs. dot, ellipse vs. dot, dot vs. line, etc.)
 6. RangeBar/RangeArea: Other mark types
    a. lowest high
    b. highest low
    c. largest variation
    d. smallest variation
 7. Whisker: other mark types
    a. All low ticks
    b. All high ticks
 8. Display a reference line on sparkline
    a. Particular x value
    b. Particular y value
 9. Band of y-values feature
    - See the ET article
10. x/y args for Line and Area?
11. Ability to set baseline
12. Axes?
13. Labels?
14. Opacity features.
15. Combining multiple data sets in one sparkline.
    a. Overlapping
    b. One above the others
16. Explore using preserveAspectRatio for keeping sparkline shape.
17. Potential support for desc, title, longdesc, alt, etc. for accessibility
    a. Maybe talk to accessibility experts about sparklines
    b. From SVG IG meeting
18. Can we generate a reasonable graph from a few thousand data points
        maybe by summarizing?
    a. From SVG IG meeting
19. Auto-slope feature (aim for slopes of 45 deg)
    a. need sampling theory

Notes from Aug 6 SVG IG meeting

DavePorter:Wade, what are some good sources for open-source graphing  
modules for SVG, like "big charts" you mentioned, with all the options  
like axes or labels?  Realizing this is off your topic, but you  
probably have some experience here.
[09:38am]codedread:fyi, launchpad.net has added sparklines recently  
(implemented in Canvas): https://code.launchpad.net/scour (takes some  
time to load)
[09:38am]an:Jeff: how easy/tough is it to integrate in a webpage
[09:39am]an:G. Wade: maybe I'll offer a CGI version later ...
[09:42am]an:AN: would be cool to see little temperature curves in  
Google Earth (in the bubbles)
[09:44am]an:AN: maybe use tooltips to show min/max/mean or verbal  
description on how to interpret
[09:44am]an:Jeff: also ask the accessibility guys what they think  
about sparklines in general
an:Jeff: also ask the accessibility guys what they think about  
sparklines in general
[09:45am]an:Edward Tufte also proposes to put sparklines in tables for  
quick overviews
[09:46am]an:Rob: accessibility is also the responsibility of the  
author - at a higher level
[09:49am]codedread:Jeff: challenge is that the data might not be known  
by the author (pulled from a live service, like stock quotes)
* CGI version requested by Jeff (multiple times)
* Google Earth has ability to add data
	* AN
	* Suggested that graphs of temperatures like I did for Houston would  
be cool.
	* WebKit implementation
* Accessibility
	* Allow Developer to add a piece of text for description or alt tag,  
etc.
	* Only developer/author really knows what should be displayed
	* Don't want the text to be overwhelming, subtle like the sl itself.
	* Need to talk to accessibility experts about sparklines in general  
and SVG sparklines in specific
	* desc, longdesc, alt
* Possibility for filtering incoming data
	* Generate a reasonable graph from a few thousand data points (not  
sure it can be done.
* Need sampling theory to deal with the slope issue that I wanted to  
look at.
