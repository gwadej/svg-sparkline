SVG::Sparkline::Cookbook - Performing specific tasks with SVG::Sparklines

=head1 VERSION

This document describes L<SVG::Sparkline> version 0.2.0.

=head1 INTRODUCTION

This Cookbook was conceived as a way to make usage of the L<SVG::Sparkline>
module somewhat easier even if you do not spend a lot of time learning it.

The first thing to realize about this module is that it is not intended to
be a full mapping/charting/graphing tool. If you need fancy markers, lots of
data sets, 3D effects, and so on, you should look for a more general graphing
module. Searching CPAN for I<Chart> or I<Graph> should expose several likely
modules.

=head1 ON SPARKLINES

The sparklines concept is described in Edward Tufte's book I<Beautiful Evidence>.
An excerpt of the book relating to sparklines can be found on his website
L<http:://www.edwardtufte.com/>.

The important portions of Tufte's explanation are that a sparkline is

=over 4

=item *

Intense

=item *

Simple

=item *

Word-sized

=back

To the extent possible, I have used these principles to guide me in the 
features I decide to include or exclude from the module.

Starting at the bottom, sparklines should be I<word-sized>. We are talking
about something that can easily be embedded in text or a table. Sparklines
are not about page-sized graphics with lots of detail.

This size issue leads to the I<simple> aspect. It is hard to get hundreds of
individual data points into a word-sized graphic. Likewise a small graphic
containing 20 different datasets is likely to be overly complex. Part of the
effect of the sparkline is that it is simple enough that you can grasp it
quickly without need for extended study. This is only possible if the graphic
is as simple as possible.

Finally, Tufte says a sparkline should be intense. The data being displayed
should be dynamic enough that it shows important characteristics even after
simplifying the graphic and making it word sized.

A horizontal line, or bar graph with minimal variation is probably not going to
be very intense. Likewise a graphic with too much variation will overwhelm the
eye and lose the effect.

=head1 RECIPES

=head2 Basic Configuration

There are a few configuration items that apply to all sparkline types.

=head3 I want to embed the sparkline and the XML declaration is in the way.

The XML declaration is an optional string added at the beginning of an XML file.
It can be used to provide some standardized information to the XML parser used
to read the XML document.

Unfortunately, it can only occur at the beginning of an XML document. If you want
to embed the sparkline output in another XML document, this declaration must not
be present.

Pass the attribute C<< -nodecl => 1 >> to the L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor to
have the SVG generated without the XML declaration. For example,

    my $sp = SVG::Sparkline->new( Line => { -nodecl=>1, values=>\@data } );

Generates a sparkline without the declaration.

=head2 How to choose a Sparkline Type

Choosing the sparkline type is a judgement call based on the data you need to
display and the look you want to convey. The following suggestions may help
you decide which type is right for your circumstance.

=head3 Binary outcomes

The I<Whisker> sparkline type easily displays a series of binary outcomes, such
as wins/losses on a game or coin flips (heads/tails).

=head3 Discrete data

The I<Bar> sparkline type displays discrete data well. When attempting to
compare a number of values, I<Bar> displays work well. When continuous data
has been aggregated into a small number of categories, (e.g. rainfall amount
per month for twelve months), a I<Bar> sparkline also works well.

=head3 Time-series data

When attempting to display continuously changing data or time-series data,
the I<Line> and I<Area> sparkline types are most appropriate.

=head2 Creating basic sparklines

=head3 I want to create a sparkline for time-series data.

Let's say you have a set of data points that represent regular samples of
a time-series data set in the array C<@samples>. To create a simple
sparkline, you would do the following:

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Line => { values => \@samples } );

=head2 Changing the display

Once you have sparkline type, you may need to customize the sparkline.

=head3 How do I make the sparkline taller/shorter?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<height> parameter that
controls the pixel height of the sparkline. Since the data is automatically
scaled to fit the height, this attribute also helps determine the resolution that
is displayed.

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Line => { values =>\@samples, height=>15 } );

The above code generates a sparkline 1.5x as tall as the default. Although SVG
supports (practically) infinitely scalable graphics, You should tend to make
your sparklines close to the height of the text you are embedding it within.

If you need graphs substantially larger than that, another graphing library with
more customizability is probably a better choice.

=head3 How do I extend/reduce the sparkline horizontally?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<width> parameter that
specifies the width of the sparkline in pixels. L<SVG::Sparkline> uses this
parameter to scale the sparkline horizontally. For I<Line> and I<Area> sparklines
this changes the horizontal resolution of the data. For I<Bar> and I<Whisker>
sparklines this changes the width of the bar or whisker.

   my $sl => SVG::Sparkline->new( Bar => { values=>\@rainfall, width=>60 } );

Assuming that we have one rainfall entry per month in the C<@rainfall> array, this
would give us a 60 pixel wide sparkline, with each bar being 5 pixels wide.

=head3 How do I change the color of the sparkline?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<color> parameter that
specifies the color of the display element. The value of this parameter must be
in a format that SVG understands.

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Area => { values=>\@depth, color=>'#0000ff' } );

This would make an area graph with the filled area being blue. See the recipe
L</"How do I specify a color for the line or background?"> for legal color formats.

=head3 How do I change the color of the background?

The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<bgcolor> parameter that
specifies the color of the background. The value of this parameter must be
in a format that SVG understands.

   my $sl = SVG::Sparkline->new( Line => { values=>\@depth, bgcolor=>'silver' } );

This would make a line graph on a light gray background. See the recipe
L</"How do I specify a color for the line or background?"> for legal color formats.

=head3 How do I specify a color for the line or background?

Colors are specified using the color definitions defined for SVG. These formats include

=over 4

=item 6 digit rgb hex

This is the normal HTML colors you may already be used to. C<#88ff88> would be a
light green.

=item 3 digit rgb hex

This is a short form of the normal hex string C<#f00> would be red. To convert the
3 digit form into the 6 digit form, just double each digit (C<#f00> becomes C<#ff0000>
and C<#123> becomes C<#112233>).

=item rgb() functional notation

This form takes three number between 0 and 255. So, C<rgb(255,0,127)> is equivalent
to C<#ff007f>.

=item rgb() percentage functional notation

This is like the previous form, but uses percentages instead. (e.g. C<rgb(100%,50%,75%)>).

=item color names

The SVG specification has an extended list of color names that can be used to
name colors. This includes the normal colors of I<red>, I<green>, I<blue>, I<white>,
I<black>, I<yellow>, I<magenta>, I<cyan>, I<gray>, I<silver>, etc.

=head3 I want the Whiskers to be thicker/thinner.

There are two ways to change the thickness of the whiskers on a I<Whisker>
sparkline. The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<thick>
parameter that specifies the whisker thickness (in pixels) on a I<Whisker>
sparkline. For example,

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline( Whisker=>{ values=>\@tosses, thick=>2 } );

generates whiskers that are 2 pixels wide, instead of the default 1.

Specifying a I<width> different than the default also changes the
whisker size. The whisker size defaults to 1/3 the I<width> divided by the
number of data points.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline( Whisker=>{ values=>\@tosses, width=>120 } );

If there are 10 values in C<@tosses>, the whiskers are drawn 4 pixels wide.

=head3 I want the Line to be thicker/thinner.

The thickness of the line on the I<Line> sparkline is controlled by the optional
I<thick> parameter to the constructor. This parameter specifies the stroke width
of the line in pixels.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline( Line=>{ values=>\@highs, thick=>2 } );

generates a line 2 pixels wide instead of the default 1 pixel line.

=head3 I want the bars to be wider/narrower.

There are two ways to change the width of the bars on a I<Bar> sparkline.
The L<SVG::Sparkline> constructor supports an optional I<thick> parameter that
specifies the bar thickness (in pixels) on a I<Bar> sparkline. For example,

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline( Bar=>{ values=>\@rainfall, thick=>6 } );

generates bars that are 6 pixels wide, instead of the default 3.

Specifying a I<width> different than the default also changes the bar size. The
bar size defaults to the I<width> divided by the number of data points.

  my $sl = SVG::Sparkline( Bar=>{ values=>\@rainfall, width=>120 } );

If we assume 12 months of data in C<@rainfall>, the bars are drawn 10 pixels wide.
